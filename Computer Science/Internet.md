# Internet
**The Internet** â€” a [[Network|network]] of *Inter*-connected *Net*works.

The main part of the Internet is called **the Internet [[Backbone|backbone]]**.
It connect several large networks at various points on the globe. 

Each continent uses backbone cables connected by trans-continental leased lines
laid across the sea beds. National Internet Service Providers (**ISPs**)
connect directly to this backbone and distribute the Internet connection to
smaller providers who in turn provide access to individual homes and
businesses.

A collection of resources accessed via the Internet is called the **World Wide
Web (WWW)**.

Because each device on a network needs to be uniquely identified, the
[[IP address]] addressing system is used.
