# URL 
**Uniform Resource Locator** â€” the full address used to find files on the
Internet.

The address is made up of several parts:
- the **[[Protocol|protocol]]** being used, which could be http, https or ftp
- the **[[Domain name|domain name]]**, which is the location of the resource on
  the Internet
- the **filename** to locate the specific file needed. If the file is located
  within a subdirectory on the server then a pathname, including the directory
  name and filename, will be given instead of a simple filename.

![URL](url.png) 

*Note*: *www.awebsite.co.uk* is the [[Domain name|domain name]].
