# Star topology
**Star topology** -- an arrangement where a central node or hub provides a
common connection point for all other nodes.

The central node is often a **switch**. It sends each communication to the
specific computer it is intended for.

Advantages:
- Easy to isolate problems
- Good performance
- More secure if a switch is used as data is sent only to the recipient

Disadvantages:
- Can be expensive to set up because of the length of cable required
- Central device is point of failure
