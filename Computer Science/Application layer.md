# Application layer
**Application layer** is used to provide services for applications that want to
communicate across a network, often the Internet.

It uses high-level protocols that set an agreed standard between the
communication end-points.

*Example:* SMTP (for e-mail), FTP (for file transfer), HTTPS (for web
browsing).

It does not actually determine how the data is transmitted, rather specifies
the rules of what should be sent.
