# Control Unit
**Control Unit** â€” a part of a processor that controls and coordinates its
activities, directing the flow of data between the CPU and other devices. 

Instructions are decoded in the control unit. It accepts the next instruction,
decodes it into several sequential steps such as fetching addresses and data
from memory, manages its execution and stores the resulting data back in memory
or registers.
