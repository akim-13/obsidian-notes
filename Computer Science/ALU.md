# Arithmetic Logic Unit
**ALU** â€” the part of the [[CPU]] that performs arithmetic and logical
operations on the data. 

It can perform instructions on fixed or floating point numbers such as:
 - ADD
 - SUBTRACT
 - MULTIPLY
 - DIVIDE

It can also perform **shift operations**, shifting bits to the left or right
within a register. 

It can carry out **boolean logic operations**, comparing two
values and using operators:
 - AND
 - OR 
 - NOT
 - XOR

The results of its calculations are stored in the [[Accumulator|accumulator]].
