# Domain name
**Domain name** uniquely identifies organisations or groups on the
[[Internet]].

Domain names are used, because people cannot remember 
[[IP address|IP addresses]].

*Example*: [bbc.co.uk]()
- *bbc* is the name of the organisation
- *.co* indicates that it is a company. This part of the name is referred to as
  the **top-level domain name**. It indicates the type of organisation. 
- *.uk* indicates that the website is registered in the UK.

Some commonly used top-level domains are:
- *.com* indicates that the organisation is commercial, i.e. a business
- *.gov* indicates that the organisation is part of the government
- *.ac* indicates that the organisation is an academic institution, usually a
  college or university
- *.sch* indicates that the organisation is a school
- *.org* indicates an organisation other than a commercial business, for example,
  a charity or trade union
- *.net* indicates a company providing Internet services.

Often the *www* does not need to be typed before the domain name as most commonly
used websites are accessed via *www*. Where the *www* is typed the domain name is
known as a **fully qualified domain name** (FQDN) and is completely unambiguous as
it can only relate to one host. The domain *bbc.co.uk* might also contain other
hosts with different names, e.g. *mail.bbc.co.uk* or *ftp.bbc.co.uk*.

Domain names follow a **hierarchical structure**:
