# Transport layer
**Transport layer** uses the Transmission Control Protocol (**TCP**) to
establish an end-to-end connection with the recipient computer.

It splits data into packets and number them sequentially, and adds port number
to be used based on HTTP protocol. At the receiving end this layer confirms
that packets have been received and requests any missing packets be resent.
