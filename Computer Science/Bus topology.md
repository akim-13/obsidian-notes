# Bus topology
**Bus topology** -- an arrangement where nodes are connected in a daisy chain
by a single central communications channel.

**Bus networks** operate in the following way:
1. All nodes are connected to a single backbone cable
2. Each end of the backbone is connected to either a terminator or a computer
   which stops signals "bouncing back"
3. Each node is passive
4. Data is sent in one direction a t a time only
5. Only one computer can transmit successfully at any one time

*Advantages:*
- Inexpensive to set up
- Devices can easily be added
- Good for small networks

*Disadvantages:*
- Main cable is a point of failure
- Limited cable length
- Performance degrades with heavy use, owing to data "collisions"
- Poor security
