# DNS
**Domain Name System servers** -- dedicated computers with an index of domain
names and their corresponding IP addresses.

When a computer queries a DNS server for a domain name, the server return an IP
address that the computer can use to send a message to it.

*Example:* www.google.co.uk is equivalent to 216.58.209.99.

There are **13 root DNS servers** that work together to catalogue every domain
name. These are segmented into geographical groupings or levels. When the IP
address of a given domain is not known it is referred to a related domain server
that may know.
