# Number of cores
In a traditional computer, instructions are Fetched, Decoded and Executed one
at a time in a serial manner. However, many computers nowadays have multiple
cores: 

 - A **dual-core** [[CPU|processor]] has *two* processors linked together in the same
   integrated circuit.
 - A **quad-core** processor has *four* processors linked processors in the same
   integrated circuit
 - An **octa-core** processor has *eight* processors linked processors in the
   same integrated circuit

 Each core is theoretically able to process a different instruction at the same
 time with its own [[Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle]], making the processor two, four
 or even eight times faster with a higher core chip.  However, although a
 dual-core processor has twice the power, it does not always perform twice as
 fast, because *the software may not always be able to take full advantage of
 both processors.*
