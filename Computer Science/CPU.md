# The Central Processing Unit
**CPU** — the primary component of a computer that processes instructions.

The [[System clock|clock speed]] of the CPU is one way to compare processors,
but it is possible for a processor with a lower clock speed to outperform one
with a higher clock speed. This is because there are other factors that
influence a processor’s performance, notably [[Cache memory|cache size]],
[[Pipelining|pipelining]] and [[Number of cores|number of cores]].

Processors work by continually fetching instructions from memory, decoding them
and executing them. This is known as the [[Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle]].

A processor consists of different parts:
  - [[ALU]]
  - [[Control unit]] 
  - [[Registers]]
  - [[Buses]]
