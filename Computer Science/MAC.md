# MAC
**Media Access Control** â€” a unique identifier of a physical device.

It uses Network Interface Card (**NIC**).

This may be the destination computer, or a router in transit.

Packets move up and down the lower layers of the stack as they hop across
routers, changing their source and destination MAC addresses as they go.
