# IP address
**Internet Protocol address** â€” a number that uniquely identifies every
computer that sends or receives data on a [[Network|network]] and on the
[[Internet]].

IP version 4 (**IPv4**) addresses are made up of four octet[^octet] values each
separated by a full-stop.

*Example:* 14.132.250.10 or 230.197.1.192

There are no longer enough IPv4 addresses available, so version 6 (**IPv6**) is
used to extend this, giving enough for more than $3 \times 10^{12}$ separate
addresses.

Humans cannot memorise strings of random numbers, that's why 
[[Domain name|domain names]] are used.

However, the protocol used to transmit data ([[TCP-IP|TCP/IP]]) can only work
with numbers, so to [[Resolving an IP address|resolve an IP address]] the
[[DNS]] servers are used.

IP address can be [[Private IP address|private]] and [[Public IP address|public]]. 
Devices within a [[LAN]] with private IP addresses can be connected to the 
[[Internet]] via a [[Router|router]] or a [[Proxy server|proxy server]], which 
in turn must have a public IP address.
