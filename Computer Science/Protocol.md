# Protocol
**Protocol** â€” a set of rules, or a formal description, of the format of a
digital transmission.

It will cover, for example, the size of the packets, the contents and format of
the header, the error detection and correction procedure.

The protocols should be standard across all devices, in all networks in order
for communication to work.

[[TCP-IP protocol stack|TCP-IP]] has become the global standard suite of
networking protocols.
