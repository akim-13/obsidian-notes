# Program Counter
**PC** â€” a [[Registers|register]] which holds the address of the next instruction to be
executed.

This may be the next instruction in a sequence of instructions, or, if the
current instruction is a branch or jump instruction, the address to jump to,
copied from the [[CIR]] to the PC.
