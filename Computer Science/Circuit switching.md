# Circuit switching
**Circuit switching** -- the proces of creating a communication connection
between tow endpoints for the duration of a phone call or transfer of data.

Circuit switching doesn not work for the billions of inter-connected parts of
the Internet, so [[Packet switching|packet switching]] was developed to allow
a communications channel to be shared so that when one communication was
temporarily not using it another could.
