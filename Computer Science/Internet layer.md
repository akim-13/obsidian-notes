# Internet layer
**Internet layer** uses the Internet Protocol ([[IP address]]) to address packets with
the source and destination IP addresses.

A router forwards each packet towards an endpoint called a **socket**, defined
by the combination of IP address and port number, e.g. *42.205.110.140:80*.

Each router uses a routing table to instruct the next hop.
