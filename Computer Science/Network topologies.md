# Network topologies
**Network topology** -- the arrangement of the various computing devices which
make up a computer network.

- [[Bus topology]]
- [[Star topology]]
- [[Mesh topology]]

There are [[Physical topology|physical]] and [[Logical topology|logical]]
topologies.

*Example:* a network wired in star topology can behave logically as a bus
network by using a bus protocol and appropriate physical switching.
