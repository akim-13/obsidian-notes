# Mesh topology
**Mesh topology** -- an arrangement where each node in a mesh network has a
connection to every other node, by transmitting data across any intermediate
nodes.

It operates as following:
1. Each node in a mesh network has a connection to every other node, by
   transmitting data across any intermediate nodes
2. Only one node requires a connection to the Internet and all others can share
   this connection.

Mesh networks are becoming more common with the widespread use of wireless
technology.

*Advantages:*
- Manages high amounts of traffic, because multiple devices can transmit data
  simultaneously
- A failure of 1 device does not cause a break in the network or transmission
  of data
- Adding additional devices does not disrupt data transmission between other
  devices
- Faster communication since data packets do not need to travel via a central
  switch

*Disadvantages:*
- The cost to implement is higher than other network topologies, making it a
  less desirable option
- Building and maintaining the topology is difficult and time consuming
- The chance of redundant connections is high, this adds to the high costs and
  potential for reduced efficiency
