# Private IP address
**Private (non-routable) IP address** â€” IP addresses used by private networks 
([[LAN|LANs]]).

That means they are not directly connected to the [[Internet]], so they only
have to be uniquely identified within the LAN. Nevertheless, the IP address is
needed in order to route data around the network.
