# Externalities

**Externalities** -- a third-person side effect.

It means there are *external* benefits ([[Positive Externalities]]) or external costs ([[Negative externalities]]) to someone other than
the original decision maker.

It's a [[Market failure|market failure]] because the free market fails to
include external costs or external benefits. With no government involvement
there would be too much of some goods and too little of others.

*Example:* smoking cigarettes -- the free market assumes that the cost of
smoking is fully paid by people who smoke, however the second hand (passive)
smoking is bad for people around you, hence it's an external cost.
