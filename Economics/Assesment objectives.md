    *Example:* Assess the opportunity cost of increasing UK health

    *Answer:* It is a good thing (the National Insurance Certificate
    – NIC) because an economy needs healthy workers to produce output.
    If people are getting sick, then they will not be able to work, and
    economic output will decrease. However, to pay for the increased
    spending, taxes may need to increase. Some people may not wish to
    pay higher taxes which are used to fund other people’s healthcare.
    If people feel they are paying too much in tax, then they may seek
    to avoid paying tax by moving their wealth to offshore accounts. If
    this happened, then tax revenues may actually decrease, lowering the
    amount of money available to spend by the government.
