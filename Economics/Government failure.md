# Government failure
**Government failure** occurs when government intervention in markets leads to
a net welfare loss in comparison to the free market operating alone.

Government failure causes a **misallocation of resources** because the
intervention creates a worsening of market failure causing allocative
inefficiency

**The law of unintended consequences** â€” unexpected events occur due to
government intervention.

This can occur for a variety of reasons:
	- Inadequate information
	- Conflicting objectives
	- Administrative costs
