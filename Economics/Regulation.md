# Regulation
**Regulation** â€” a set of rules to protect consumers.

Regulation is undertaken by government to create competitive markets. The
government believes that this will protect the interests of consumers so that
they are not exploited by firms.

Effective regulation will lead to *greater choice* and *lower prices*.
