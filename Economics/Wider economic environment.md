# Interest rates
**Interest rate** -- the price of money. Either a reward for lending money to
bank or the price of lending money from someone.

*Example:* If ECB[^ecb]  rises the interest rates, a foreigner could buy
euros and grow their wealth.

[^ecb]: Europe Central Bank
# Exchange rates
**Appreciation** -- when the value of the currency goes up. Good for
*importers*, because they can buy more foreign products for the same amount of
money. Bad for *exporters*.

**Depreciation** -- when the value of the currency goes down. Good for
*exporters*, because their products become more competitive on the
international market. Bad for *importers*.

**Interdependence** -- you can't make everything yourself.

# Taxes
**Taxation** -- the process of imposing charges  on business and individuals by
the government.

**Corporation tax** -- tax on firm's profit.
**Value Added Tax (VAT)** -- consumers are charged VAT on goods and services
bought as well as income tax on earnings.

# Unemployment
Unemployment -- the number of people looking for job, but who cannot find a job
at a point at time.

*High unemployment* means lower cost for businesses and it's also easier to find
workers. But there is also less disposable income (everybody is poor, so they
can't buy business's products).

*Low unemployment* means the workers demand a higher wage, meaning higher cost
for business, but there is more people who are able to buy products.

Students aren't unemployed, because they're on full-time education.

# Inflation
**Inflation** -- general rise in prices or a fall in the value of money.

The rate of inflation shows how prices have changed based on the same period a
year earlier. It is an indication of the cost of living changing.

There are tow main measurements:
- **Retail Price Index (RPI)** -- a measurement of a 'basket' of goods and
  services representative of what people but in the UK.
  **Basket** -- the goods that most of the people buy (i.e. food, phones,
  clothing).
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** -- a price index, which weighs the price of a
  weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by
  household. Similar to RPI but mainly excluding housing costs.
