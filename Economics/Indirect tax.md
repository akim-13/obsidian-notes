# Indirect tax
**Indirect tax** â€” a tax on a good or a service.


![Indirect](indirect.png) 

The imposition of an indirect tax will lead to an increase in the cost of
supply for a firm. This will lead to a shift in the supply curve up and to the
left. Quantity supplied will decrease by Q-Q1.  P will increase from P to P1.

The increase in tax has caused the price to rise by the vertical distance
between the supply curves. The incidence (amount) of the tax paid for by the
producer is shown by the blue line (equivalent to P-P0). The incidence of the
tax paid for by the consumer is shown by the green line (P1-P).
