# Aggregate Demand
## Definition & Formula
**Aggregate demand** — the sum total of demand from all sources in the economy.

$$ AD = C + I + G + (X-M) $$ ^ad-formula

 - $C$ : **Consumption** — total household spending on goods and services.
 - $I$ : **Investment** — spending now on capital assets that will generate income in the future.
 - $G$ : **Government expenditure** — all kinds of public spending on health, education, welfare, defence, etc.
 - $X-M$ : **Exports & Imports (respectively)** — the balance of trade. This can be a net
 injection if $X>M$ or a net leakage vice versa.

## Aggregate Demand Curve
**Aggregate demand curve** — a diagram representing the total level of demand in the economy at different price levels.

 - **Movement along** the AD curve occurs when there is a change in **price level**.
 - The AD curve **shifts** to the left/right when [[#^ad-formula|the sum of the components]] becomes smaller/greater respectively.
