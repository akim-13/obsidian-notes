# Aggregate Demand
**Aggregate demand** — the sum total of demand from all sources in the economy.

$$ AD = C + I + G + (X-M) $$

Components:
 - **Consumption (C)** — total household spending on goods and services.
 - **Investment (I)** — spending now on capital assets that will generate income
 in the future.
 - **Government expenditure (G)** — all kinds of public spending on health,
 education, welfare, defence, etc.
 - **Exports (X) minus Imports (M)** — the balance of trade. This can be a net
 injection if $X>M$ or a net leakage vice versa.
