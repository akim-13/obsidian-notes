# Negative externalities

**Negative externality** -- external cost.

To fix a negative externility the government should tax the amount of the
externality, meaning it should itrdocue a **Per Unit Tax**. 

An alternative way to fix it is the introduction of a **Lump Sum Tax** -- a tax
which changes the fixed costs, i.e. no matter how much output is produced, the
government charges the firm a fixed amount of money.

## Formulae
$$ Total\ Social\ Cost = Private\ Cost + External\ Cost $$
$$ MSC = MPC + MEC $$

**MSC (Marginal Social Cost)** -- additional cost of producing additional unit
of goods accruing to the **society**.

**MPC (Marginal Private Cost)** -- additional cost of producing additional unit
of goods accruing to the **firm**.

**MEC (Marginal External Cost)** -- additional external cost created by one
more unit of the good.

**MSB (Marginal Social Benefits)** -- a demand curve or something idk
