# Aggregate Supply
**Aggregate supply** — the total output from all sources in the economy.

## Short Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)
In the short run all **factors of production assumed to be fixed**. The only exception to this is that firms may be able to hire more labour, or make existing labour and other existing resources work harder, in order to meet aggregate demand.

### Movements Along SRAS

Changes in [[aggregate demand]] lead to movements along the SRAS curve e.g. if AD increases, firms will hire more labour and make resources work harder in order to boost supply as they see an opportunity to increase profits.

### Shifts of the SRAS Curve

An *increase* in costs of production shifts SRAS to the *left* (SRAS2), i.e. decreases it, and vice versa. This can be caused by changes in **costs of raw materials and energy**.

*Example:* higher raw material prices e.g. oil and metals increase the firm’s costs of production and will reduce SRAS. This will lead to a shift in the supply curve to the left and will have impacts on both price and quantity supplied as a reduction in firms’ output means an increase in price.

## Long Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)
In the long run, **all factors of production are variable** and can be increased over time.

In effect, long run aggregate supply represents the **maximum possible output** an economy can produce as determined by its available land, labour, capital and entrepreneurial resources.

- The **horizontal part** of the LRAS curve shows that so long as there is plenty of spare capacity in the economy, and input prices do not rise, more can be produced without raising prices (AD1→AD2).
- The **curved part** of the LRAS curve shows that as the economy gets closer to full capacity output, resource inputs become scarce. Skill shortages develop and businesses compete for  both people and raw materials, so wages, other costs and prices will rise.
- The **vertical part** of the LRAS represents full capacity output, meaning there are no resources left to increase LRAS so any increase in AD will just raise the general price level, i.e [[inflation]].

### Shifts of the LRAS Curve

 - LRAS can shift when there is a change in the quantity and/or quality of the factors of production.
   - The better the quality (or the larger the quantity), the higher the LRAS is.
 - Technological advances
   - Can reduce the cost of production and increase **productivity**
   - This leads to an increase in supply, i.e. **shift to the right**, as firms already in the industry can increase production to earn higher profits 
   - Other firms might enter the industry as the new technology has made it easier and cheaper to produce goods and services, thus allowing them to be profitable
 - Education and skills
   - Can also improve **productivity** through training and education of the workforce, therefore increasing LRAS.
 - Changes in productivity in general
   - More productive — higher LRAS, as capacity is better utilised.
