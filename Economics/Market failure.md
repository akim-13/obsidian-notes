# Market failure

**Market failure** -- a situation in which the free-market system fails to
satisfy society's wants and resources aren't allocated efficiently. In other
words, when the invisible hand doesn't work[^adam].

Private markets[^free] do not efficiently bring about the allocation of resources,
so the government must step in to satisfy society's wants.

[[Externalities]] is one type of a market failure.


[^adam]: A quote by Adam Smith
[^free]: The same as free market, meaning minimal government involvement.
