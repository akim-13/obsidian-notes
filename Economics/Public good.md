# Public good
For a good to be public it should be:
 - **Non-rival** — if I consume the thing, I do not affect anyone else's ability
   to consume it.
 
   *Example:* street lights — your benefit from the lights and your ability to
   benefit does not affect anyone else's ability to benefit.
 - **Non-excludable** — if you cannot physically stop/block someone from
   enjoying the benefits.
 
   *Example:* defence — if a nation has an army, that should provide protection,
   which you cannot stop a citizen from enjoying.
 
   In a free market, public goods will be **under-produced**. Therefore, the
   government will intervene to provide these public goods.
