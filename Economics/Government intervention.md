# Government intervention
Governments intervene in order to reduce market failure to:
- Reduce or eliminate negative externalities
- Increase or maximise positive externalities
- Increase the supply of merit goods
- Reduce the supply of demerit goods
- Supply public goods that would be under-supplied by the market

To fix inequality the government might:
 - Tax producers
 - Give people money (e.g. stimulus cheques)
 - Introduce Progressive Income Tax â€” the wealthier pay higher rates of tax
